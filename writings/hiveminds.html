<h1>Hive minds: Modelling and Pondering</h1>

<p><i>im doing something actually interesting this time</i></p>

  Hive minds are a common cultural phenomenon seen primarily in sci-fi, and are conceptually pretty awesome. 
  However, I've always wondered about which of the forms of collective intelligence are most effective at ruling.
  I've always said that <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-_cJJD070U&list=PLfIss4eoF7hy3DWjL90AdE_zJz7sjQddD>
    "twitch chat is the worst type of hive mind,"</a> but I've never actually theoretically verified that statement.
  So what I'll do here is try to model hive minds, and maybe give some commentary on the moral/political value of
  hive minds at the end.
