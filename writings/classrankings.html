  <title>Ranking Terraria Classes</title>
  
  <h1>Screw it, let's rank the Terraria classes</h1>

  <p><i>summoner gaming is my favorite type of gaming</i></p>

  <b1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p1>O.K, the hivemind blog post is currently undergoing the month-long plight of my motivational power level being far too low to handle writing a blog post about something that requires
    research, so I'm going to write something short and easy to get my mind back into productive gear.<br><br></p1>
    <p2>Terraria classes! A lot of people tend to ignore them on their first playthrough, but sticking to a specific class's armor and weaponry is a fun addition. Considering that I have
    almost 1000 hours in Terraria, trying to play the game as optimally as possible gets really boring due to the low difficulty level, so I try to add challenges by restricting what I can and 
    can't use. For example, I once did a terraria playthrough where I only used spell tomes throughout the game (which, if you know anything about Terraria, are fairly sparse).<br><br></p2>

    <p3>Despite my wording implying that sticking to a specific class only adds challenge, it highly optimizes the damage that your weapons do, making the tasks that you do in a typical 
    run easier. The 4 main classes are our focus today, and we'll first talk about...</p3>
  </b1>

  <b2>
    <h2>Metric</h2>
    <p1>To describe the viability of a given class, I'm going to heuristically combine the relative ease of completing the game with the potential of the class to perform well at various stages
    of the game. I'm not going to be doing any math to justify rankings because I am currently too lazy to do something like that, but I'll be discussing why I put a class in a given spot 
    based off of the metrics given here.<br><br></p1>

    <p2>I'll also be ranking the classes in both a singleplayer and multiplayer setting because I think that the discussion behind singleplayer viability differs highly from the discussion about
     multiplayer viabilty.</p2>
  </b2>

  <b3>
    <h2>The Actual Ranking</h2>
    <p1>I'll give the actual ranking here and then explain it later. Are you ready? Here goes:<br><br></p1>
    <label for=Singleplayer>Singleplayer:</label>
    <ol id=Singleplayer>
      <li>Ranged</li>
      <li>Melee</li>
      <li>Mage</li>
      <li>Summoner</li>
    </ol>

    <label for=Multiplayer>Multiplayer:</label>
    <ol id=Multiplayer>
      <li>Mage</li>
      <li>Summoner</li>
      <li>Ranger</li>
      <li>Melee</li>
    </ol>
  </b3>

    <h2>O.K, let's talk about it</h2>
    <p1>Some of you may be shaking your head in agreement or disagreement, some of you may be screaming at your computer screen (not many I assume), but allow me to explain.</p1>

    <h3>Singleplayer</h3>
    <h4>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Ranged, Summoner, and Melee</h4>
    <p2>I would first like to talk about the 3 classes with a very defined viability level in singleplayer Terraria.</p2>
    <h5>The Good: Ranger</h5>
    <p3>Ranger is by far the best singleplayer class in Terraria. It's the second most tanky, it deals high DPS from a far range, and it has an abundance of weapons and ammo for it to choose
     from. A lot of these weapons, such as the Daedalus stormbow, are overpowered as hell. The stormbow can carry your ranger from the beginning of hardmode to plantera while still outclassing
    other options available. Pre-boss, ore bows are some of the best options available to keep your fragile player away from the threats that early-game Terraria possesses. <br>
      Rangers in Terraria are not requried to approach an enemy to deal damage to them, meaning that they can keep their distance. This should imply that rangers are very squishy, but they 
      have the second highest defense out of the armors that are given to you. The tankiness, large variety of weapons, and ability to keep a good distance means that ranger becomes a 
      Jack of all Trades, master of... all Trades. That's very important in singleplayer, as there isn't another player to cover your weaknesses in-game (we'll talk about this more in 
      the multiplayer rating).
      </p3>

    <h5>The Bad: Summoner</h5>
    <p4>By "bad" , I do not mean that I dislike summoner. As stated by the flavor text, summoner is my favorite class.<br></p4>
    <p5>Summoner is a class that requires a lot to play (in multiple senses of the word) without giving you much reward. Summoner items are still few and far between compared to
      other classes (even with the recent updates), which means that it's going to be harder to keep up with increasingly stronger foes when you still have gear from 2 bosses ago. Now, this is 
      definitely a slight exaggeration, post-1.4, solo-summoner is very much a viable class that can output high dps, but that DPS requires much more work to achieve than other classes. Summoner
       is also the squishiest class in the game, and it can't keep the same distance from enemies that ranger or mage can if it wishes to use its whip. Summoner is also more of a specialist than 
      ranger and melee, as it focuses on applying constant chip damage to wittle down the enemies' health while focusing on avoiding attacks. This role is better-suited for multiplayer (which is 
      why it takes the #2 spot), but is not as viable as other strategies in singleplayer. Summoner weapons also don't have very much variety, as most of them are AOE-focused. This fact does, 
      however, make Summoner great for mining, events, and building (which we'll talk about even more in the multiplayer section).
    </p5>

    <h5>The Ugly: Melee</h5>
    <p6><i>please do not mention the Zenith, it's an endgame weapon and doesn't belong in this conversation</i><br><br></p6>
