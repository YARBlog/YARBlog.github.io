  <h1>Screw it, let's rank the Terraria classes</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p1>O.K, the hivemind blog post is currently undergoing the month-long plight of my motivational power level being far too low to handle writing a blog post about something that requires
    research, so I'm going to write something short and easy to get my mind back into productive gear.<br><br></p1>
    <p2>Terraria classes! A lot of people tend to kind of ignore them on their first playthrough, but sticking to a specific class's armor and weaponry is a fun addition. Considering that I have
    almost 1000 hours in Terraria, trying to play the game as optimally as possible gets really boring due to the low difficulty level, so I try to add challenges by restricting what I can and 
    can't use. For example, I once did a terraria playthrough where I only used spell tomes throughout the game (which, if you know anything about Terraria, are fairly sparse).</p2>
