<title>Hive minds: Modelling and Pondering</title>

<h1>Hive minds: Modelling and Pondering</h1>

<p><i>im doing something actually interesting this time</i></p>

<b1>
<p>
  Hive minds are a common cultural phenomenon seen primarily in sci-fi, and are conceptually pretty awesome. 
  However, I've always wondered about which of the forms of collective intelligence are most effective at ruling.
  I've always said that <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-_cJJD070U&list=PLfIss4eoF7hy3DWjL90AdE_zJz7sjQddD>
    "twitch chat is the worst type of hive mind,"</a> but I've never actually theoretically verified that statement.
  So what I'll do here is try to model hive minds, and maybe give some commentary on the moral/political value of
  hive minds at the end.

  <h2>Formalizing</h2>
  <p><i>buzz buzz (earthbound reference???)</i></p>
  <p1>
    OK, when talking to my friends about certain ideas I have about hive minds, a lot of the discussion came around to
    arguing about what a hive mind actually is. <br>
    
    Mathematically, we think about a hive mind as a network (or set) <math>M</math> of state machines <math>m_1, m_2, ... m_i</math>
    that each take input from some environment <math>E</math> and some arbitrary amount of other state machines. 
    These state machines each have an output goal <math>g</math> that they will try to reach (whether it be making it 
    to a certain position or collecting a certain volume of water or whatever combination of those that you wish).
    <math>g</math> should contain some "metadata" about how to achieve <math>g</math>.

  <h3>The 3 types of hive minds</h3>
    <p2>
    What we perceive as a hive mind is actually 3 different catagories of 
    """collective""" (see "Overmind") intelligence. These are:
    <ul>
      <li>Swarms</li>
      <li>Democracies</li>
      <li>Overminds</li>
    </ul>
  </p2>

  <h2>Murmurations</h2>

  <p1>
    <br>We'll start with (what is in my opinion) one of the most beautiful natural phenomena out there. I would consider
    murmurations (or swarms in general) to be a type of hive mind.
